# 23K256-test
Script for testing 23K256 SRAM chip in various modes
I could not find any sketch/guidance that addressed all modes of this chip, especially page mode. The datasheet appears somewhat lacking in how this mode works but after some testing I think I found the answer. This prompted me to look at other options for the chip and I created a user defined page mode which is included and tested within my sketch.
